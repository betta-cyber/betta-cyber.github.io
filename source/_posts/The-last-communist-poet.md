A poor poetï¼Œ
Beautiful lady's husband.
A Blacklisted Acmeist poet.
The last communist poet.

Whenever the cold-night overwhelms the city,
He could't keep eyes on the fire of the candle.
Hearing frivolous pacing from the mitty,
No waves could bring any seismicity.

"We must have some fun."
Can not socialize with poets, can't have sex with poets.
So why we pretend to be the poets?
Just come up with a simple game, the game of sex.

The poet's memory is prodigious,
Ugly ugly, but a sweet-tempered man with velvet tongue.
He is able to recite the saddest poems,
The poet fucks workers he meets in bus or waiting in supermarket,
Young and not-so-young workers weep when they hear it.
They make love like snake.

The poet's wife,
Whose beauty exempts from having a good memory,
Even she is more prodigious than the poet's,
She goes to bed with workers or sailors on leave,
Or with energetic widowed foreman with no longer to do with his strength,
They call it's miracle!

"Goals don't matter, movement is everything."
In most cases, they also make love in groups.
The poet, his wife, and another women,
The poet, his wife, and another men,
The party Usually is trios,
occasionally it's quartets and quintets and even more.


Good times don't last long,
The party is end, The game is end.
The poet was arrested,
Killed, and Never Heard.
