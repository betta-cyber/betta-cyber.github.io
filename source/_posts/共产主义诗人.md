### The last communist poet

A poor poet，
Beautiful lady's husband.
A blacklisted Acmeist poet.
The last communist poet.

Whenever the cold-night overwhelms the city,
He could't keep eyes on the fire of the candle.
Hearing frivolous pacing from the mitty,
No waves could bring any seismicity.

"We must have some fun."
Can not socialize with poets, can't have sex with poets.
So why we pretend to be the poets?
Just come up with a simple game, the game of sex.

The poet's memory is prodigious,
Ugly ugly, but a sweet-tempered man with velvet tongue.
He is able to recite the saddest poems,
The poet fucks workers he meets in bus or waiting in supermarket,
Young and not-so-young workers weep when they hear it.
They make love like snake.

The poet's wife,
Whose beauty exempts from having a good memory,
Even she is more prodigious than the poet's,
She goes to bed with workers or sailors on leave,
Or with energetic widowed foreman with no longer to do with his strength,
They call it's miracle!

"Goals don't matter, movement is everything."
In most cases, they also make love in groups.
The poet, his wife, and another women,
The poet, his wife, and another men,
The party Usually is trios,
occasionally it's quartets and quintets and even more.


Good times don't last long,
The party is end, The game is end.
The poet was arrested,
Killed, and Never Heard.

### 康米主义诗人

穷苦诗人，
拥有美艳妻子的诗人，
身处黑名单的阿克梅派诗人，
康米主义最后的诗人。

每当寒幕压城时，
他盯不住壁炉柴薪的火焰。
听来回的踱步轻佻，
泛不起灵感的波纹。

“总归得找点乐子”。
不能和诗人社交，也不可以和诗人性交。
索性不伪装诗人，
开展边缘化性交运动。

诗人记忆超群，
丑陋温柔，甜言蜜语。
将大段悲悲惨惨的诗行朗诵。
他同在公交或超市排队的女人性交，
年轻和不太年轻的女工热泪盈眶，
毒蛇般性交。

妻子记忆更甚，
却不需吟诗。只凭美貌。
她跟工人或者休假的水手，
或者精力充沛却无处发泄的鳏夫性交，
人间奇迹。

“目标并不重要，运动才是一切”。
有时他们一起性交，
诗人，妻子，再加一个女子。
诗人，妻子，再加一个男子。
情况好时，四人组合，五人组合，六人组合。
大张旗鼓，纵欲狂欢。

好景不长,
运动终止了。
诗人被捕，
被杀害，
被遗忘。
